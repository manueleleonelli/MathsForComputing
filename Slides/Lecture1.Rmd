## Course's Objectives

Introduce basic mathematical concepts that are fundamental in modern computing applications 

- Set Theory
- Functions
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
- Combinatorics
- Graph Theory

We will (try to) motivate their use through practical applications.

## Today's Objective

 - Introduction and presentation of the course
 - Synchronous vs asynchronous classes
 - Introduction to set theory

## Assessment
\begin{itemize}
\item Participation 20\% 
\begin{itemize}
\item Attendance in synchronous classes;
\item Participation in the asynchronous classes;
\end{itemize}
\item Quizzes 20\%
\begin{itemize}
\item  4 multiple choice quizzes consisting of 10 questions each.
\item 24hrs of time to complete it in the online campus.
\end{itemize}
\item Exam 60\%: multiple choice questions in the online campus (last lecture)
\item Although there is no fixed rule and decisions will be made case-by-case a rule of thumb is that the overall grade should be above 50\% and the exam grade above 35\%. (The module is graded but no curve is applied).
\end{itemize}


## Synchronous vs Asynchronous
\begin{itemize}
\item The module consists of 12 synchronous face2face classes and 3 asynchronous classes. 
\item For asynchronous classes you will be asked to read some documents discussing the use of mathematical techniques in practical applications and to contribute to a forum discussion.
\item For the calendar of events refer to the online campus.
\end{itemize}

## Rules

 - Attendance in class (physical) is mandatory, unless there is a justification.
 
 - Please follow the seating chart.
 
 - I don't have any other strict rule, just follow common sense!
 

## Sets
\begin{block}{}
A \emph{set} is an unordered collection of objects, called \emph{elements} or \emph{members} of the set. A set is said to \emph{contain} its elements. We write $a\in A$ to denote that $a$ is an element of the set $A$. The notation $a\not\in A$ denotes that $a$ is not an element of the set $A$.
\end{block}

\begin{exampleblock}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item The set $V$ of all vowels is $V=\{a,e,i,o,u\}$;
\item The set $O$ of odd positive integers less than 10 is $O=\{1,3,5,7,9\}$;
\item The set of positive integers less than 100 is $\{1,2,3,\dots,98,99\}$.
\item This way of describing sets is called \emph{roster method}.
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}


## Sets
Another way to describe a set is to use the \emph{set builder notation}:
\begin{exampleblock}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item $O = \{x | x \mbox{ is an odd positive integer less than } 100\}$;
\item $O = \{x \in \mathbb{Z}_+ | x \mbox{ is odd and } x <100\}$
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}

\begin{exampleblock}{}
Some famous sets:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,3,\dots\}$: the set of \emph{natural numbers};
\item $\mathbb{Z}=\{\dots, -2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}$: the set of \emph{integers};
\item $\mathbb{Z}_+ = \{1,2,3,\dots\}$': the set of \emph{positive integers};
\item $\mathbb{Q}=\{p/q | p,q\in\mathbb{Z} \mbox{ and } q\neq 0\}$: the set of \emph{rational numbers};
\item $\mathbb{R}$: the set of \emph{real numbers};
\item $\mathbb{R}_+$: the set of positive real numbers.
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}


## Intervals
Recall the notation for \emph{intervals} of real numbers. When $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ with $a<b$, we write
\begin{itemize}
\item $[a,b]=\{x\in\mathbb{R} | a\leq x \leq b\}$;
\item $[a,b)=\{x\in\mathbb{R} | a\leq x < b\}$;
\item $(a,b]=\{x\in\mathbb{R} | a < x \leq b\}$;
\item $(a,b)=\{x\in\mathbb{R} | a < x < b\}$;
\end{itemize}

Note that $[a,b]$ is called a \emph{closed interval} from $a$ to $b$ and $(a,b)$ is called an \emph{open interval} from $a$ to $b$.



## Sets
\begin{block}{}
Two sets are \emph{equal} if they have the same elements.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\{1,3,5\}$ and $\{3,5,1\}$ are equal;
\item $\{1,3,5\}$ and $\{1,3,3,5,5,5\}$ are equal;
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{alertblock}{}
Sets can have other sets as members: for instance $\{\mathbb{N},\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}\}$ is a set.
\end{alertblock}

\begin{block}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item A set with no elements is called \emph{empty set} or \emph{null set} and is denoted by $\emptyset$. 
\item A set with one element is called a \emph{singleton set}. Notice that $\emptyset \neq \{\emptyset\}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}


## Venn Diagrams
Sets can be represented graphically using Venn diagrams.
\begin{itemize}
\item The set of all objects under considerations, the universal set $U$, is represented by a rectangle;
\item Inside this rectangle, circles or other geometrical shapes are used to represent sets. 
\item Sometimes points are used to represent particular elements of a set.
\end{itemize}

## Subsets
\begin{block}{}
The set $A$ is a subset of $B$ if and only if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. We use the notation $A\subseteq B$ to indicate that $A$ is a subset of $B$.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{}
For every set $S$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\emptyset \subseteq S$;
\item $S \subseteq S$
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{img/Venn2.png}
\end{center}

## Subsets
When we wish to emphasize that a set $A$ is a subset of a set $B$ but that $A\neq B$ we write $A\subset B$ and say that $A$ is a \emph{proper subset} of $B$. 

\begin{exampleblock}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item The set of all odd positive integers less than 10 is a proper subset of the set of all positive integers less than 10;
\item The set of rational numbers is a proper subset of the set of real numbers;
\item The set of all people in China is a subset (not proper) of the set of all people in China.
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}

## Size of a Set
\begin{block}{}
Let $S$ be a set. If there are exactly $n$ distinct elements in $S$ where $n$ is a non-negative integer, we say that $S$ is a \emph{finite set} and that $n$ is the \emph{cardinality} of $S$, denoted by $|S|$.

A set is said to be \emph{infinite} if it is not finite.
\end{block}

\begin{exampleblock}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $A$ be the set of odd positive integers less than 10. Then $|A|=5$
\item Let $S$ be the set of letters in the English alphabet. Then $|S| =26$
\item The set of positive integers is infinite.
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}

## The Power Set
\begin{block}{}
Given a set $S$, the \emph{power set} of $S$ is the set of all subsets of the set $S$. The power set of $S$ is denoted by $\mathcal{P}(S)$.
\end{block}

\begin{exampleblock}{}
What is the power set of $\{0,1,2\}$?

\[
\mathcal{P}(\{0,1,2\})=
\]
\end{exampleblock}

\begin{alertblock}{}
If a set has $n$ elements, then its power set has $2^n$ elements.
\end{alertblock}

## The Power Set
\begin{block}{}
Given a set $S$, the \emph{power set} of $S$ is the set of all subsets of the set $S$. The power set of $S$ is denoted by $\mathcal{P}(S)$.
\end{block}

\begin{exampleblock}{}
What is the power set of $\{0,1,2\}$?

\[
\mathcal{P}(\{0,1,2\})=\{\emptyset,\{0\},\{1\},\{2\},\{0,1\},\{0,2\},\{1,2\},\{0,1,2\}\}
\]
\end{exampleblock}

\begin{alertblock}{}
If a set has $n$ elements, then its power set has $2^n$ elements.
\end{alertblock}

## Cartesian Products
\begin{block}{}
The \emph{ordered n-tuple} $(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)$ is the ordered collection that has $a_1$ as its first element, $a_2$ as its second element, \dots, and $a_n$ as its $n$th element.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{}
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. The \emph{Cartesian product} of $A$ and $B$ denoted by $A\times B$ is the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. Hence
$
A\times B = \{(a,b) | a\in A \mbox{ and } b\in B\}.
$
We use the notation $A^2$ to denote $A\times A$.
\end{block}

\begin{exampleblock}{}
Let $A$ represent the set of all students at a university and $B$ represent the set of all courses offered at the university. What is the Cartesian product $A\times B$ and how can it be used?
\end{exampleblock}



## Set Operations

\begin{block}{}
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{union} of the sets $A$ and $B$ denoted by $A\cup B$ is the set that contains those elements that are either in $A$ or in $B$ or in both, that is 
$
A\cup B = \{x | x\in A \mbox{ or } x\in B\}
$
\item The \emph{intersection} of the sets $A$ and $B$ denoted by $A\cap B$ is the set containing those elements in both $A$ and $B$, that is $
A \cap B = \{x| x\in A \mbox{ and } x\in B\}.
$
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{center}

\end{center}


## Set Operations

\begin{block}{}
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{difference} of the sets $A$ and $B$ denoted by $A - B$ is the set containing those elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$, that is 
$
A - B = \{x | x\in A \mbox{ an } x\not\in B\}
$
\item The \emph{complement} of the set $A$ denoted by $\bar{A}$ is $U - A$, that is $
\bar{A} = \{x| x\in U \mbox{ and } x\not \in A\}.
$
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{img/Venn4.png}
\end{center}


## Set Operations
\begin{exampleblock}{}
Let $A=\{1,3,5\}$, $B=\{1,2,3\}$ and $U = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $A\cap B = $
\item $A\cup B = $
\item $A - B  = $
\item $B - A = $
\item $\bar{A} = $
\item $\bar{B}= $
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}



## Set Operations
\begin{exampleblock}{}
Let $A=\{1,3,5\}$, $B=\{1,2,3\}$ and $U = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $A\cap B = \{ 1,3\}$
\item $A\cup B = \{1,2,3,5 \}$
\item $A - B  = \{5\}$
\item $B - A = \{2\}$
\item $\bar{A} = \{2,4\}$
\item $\bar{B}= \{4,5\}$
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}


## Set Operations
\begin{block}{}
Two sets are called \emph{disjoint} if their intersection is the empty set.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{}
The \emph{principle of inclusion-exclusion} states that
\[
|A\cup B|= |A| + |B| - |A\cap B|
\]
\end{block}
